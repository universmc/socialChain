ModalAside Component
The ModalAside component is a reusable React component that creates a modal or aside panel that slides in from either the left or right side of the screen. It's designed to display additional information, contextual menus, or specific actions outside the main content flow.

Props
The ModalAside component accepts the following props:

isOpen (boolean, required): Controls whether the modal is open or closed.
onClose (function, required): A callback function to be called when the modal should be closed.
position ('left' | 'right', optional, default: 'right'): Determines which side the modal slides in from.
children (React.ReactNode, required): The content to be displayed inside the modal.
title (string, optional): The title to be displayed at the top of the modal.
Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the ModalAside component:

import React, { useState } from 'react'
import ModalAside from './ModalAside'

function Example() {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setIsModalOpen(true)}>Open Modal</button>
      <ModalAside
        isOpen={isModalOpen}
        onClose={() => setIsModalOpen(false)}
        position="right"
        title="Example Modal"
      >
        <p>This is the content of the modal.</p>
      </ModalAside>
    </div>
  )
}
Styling
The ModalAside component uses styled-components for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying the styled components in the ModalAside.tsx file.

Accessibility
The ModalAside component includes basic accessibility features:

The close button has an aria-label for screen readers.
Clicking outside the modal will close it.
For full accessibility, ensure that you manage focus appropriately when opening and closing the modal in your application.

Performance

Modifying the styled components in the ModalAside.tsx file.
